    :param inputs: Input tensor to the attention block.
    :param attention_units: Number of units to use in the attention layer.
    :return: Output tensor of the attention block.
    """
    # Get the number of input units
    input_units = int(inputs.shape[-1])

    # Compute the attention scores
    attention_scores = Dense(units=attention_units, activation='tanh')(inputs)
    attention_scores = Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')(attention_scores)

    # Apply the attention scores to the inputs
    attention_inputs = Reshape(target_shape=(input_units,))(inputs)

    return output


# The attention_block function takes two parameters: inputs, which is the input tensor to the attention block, and attention_units, which is the number of units to use in the attention layer. The function computes attention scores for each element of the input tensor, applies these scores to the input tensor, and then combines the result with the original input tensor to produce the output of the attention block.

# To use this function in a Keras model, simply call it and pass in the appropriate input tensor and number of attention units. For example:

# python
# Copy code
# from keras.models import Model
# from keras.layers import Input, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Concatenate, Dropout, ELU, Add

# input_layer = Input(shape=(8, 8, 14))
# conv1 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu')(input_layer)

# # Apply the attention block to the output of conv1
# attention1 = attention_block(conv1, 32)

# conv2 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu')(attention1)
# # ...
# In this example, the attention_block function is applied to the output of conv1 to create attention1. This new tensor can then be passed to the next layer of the model.


# Great, the attention_block function you provided is a standalone function that can be added to a Keras model. It computes attention scores based on the input tensor and applies the scores to the inputs to create the attention output.

# Here are a few sample use cases for the attention_block function:

# Image Captioning: This function can be used to create an attention mechanism in a CNN-LSTM model for image captioning. The attention mechanism allows the model to selectively focus on different parts of the input image when generating a caption. You would use this function to create the attention block in your model, and adjust the number of attention units based on your specific needs.

# Machine Translation: Another use case for this function is in machine translation models that use an encoder-decoder architecture. In this case, the attention mechanism allows the decoder to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating the output sequence. You would use this function to create the attention block in your model, and adjust the number of attention units based on your specific needs.

# Speech Recognition: This function can also be used in CNN models for speech recognition, where the attention mechanism can help the model focus on important features of the audio signal. You would use spectrograms of the audio signals as input to your model, and the attention block would help the model selectively focus on different parts of the spectrogram.

# Natural Language Processing: The attention mechanism can also be useful in NLP tasks such as text classification or sentiment analysis. In this case, the attention mechanism can help the model focus on important words or phrases in the input text. You would use this function to create the attention block in your model, and adjust the number of attention units based on your specific needs.

# Overall, the attention_block function is a versatile building block for various types of deep learning models, and the specific parameters used in the function can be adjusted based on the specific needs of the task at hand.
